In this article, you shall learn about **scripting** in software development, which includes writing sets of **commands** in scripting languages to **automate** tasks, **customizing** software, and making **development** faster. Its significance lies in its ability to facilitate rapid **prototyping**, automate repetitive tasks, **integrate** software components, customize and extend software functionality, manage deployment and configuration, and automate **testing** and **quality assurance** processes. Here, you will be introduced to **Python**, a scripting language known for its **simplicity** and **readability**. It is popular for automation, system administration, and rapid prototyping due to its ease of learning, extensive **standard library**, platform independence, and ability to automate tasks efficiently.

# Getting Started with Python Scripting
**Setting up the Python Environment**
- **Install Python**: Following are the steps to install Python in different OS.

	- **For Windows**: Download and install Python from the  [official website][1].
	    
	- **For Ubuntu**: You can download Python using the terminal:

	      sudo apt update
	      sudo apt install python3

	- **For MacOS**: You can download Python using Homebrew:
	    
	      brew install python3
	      
	Type `python --version`  in the command prompt or terminal to verify that Python is installed correctly.

- **Code Editor or IDE**: Choose a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing Python code like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, IDLE, etc.
- **Install Packages**: You can install Python packages using the Python package manager, `pip`.

		pip install package_name

<div class="div-green"> <span class="alert-header">Tip:</span> <span class="alert-body"> It is good to set up a virtual environment for your Python project to isolate project environments by running `python -m venv env_name`, and activate it by running `.\env_name\Scripts\activate`. You can then run `deactivate` to deactivate your virtual environment.</span> </div>

**Python Interpreter and .py files**
Python scripting files, recognized by the `.py` extension, contain Python code written in plain text. They are created using text editors or IDEs. The Python interpreter is a program that executes Python code and can run scripts in interactive mode, where code is entered directly, or script mode, where it executes code from `.py` files. To run a Python script, go to its folder in the command line and type `python script.py`. This lets you create and run Python programs easily.

**Writing your first Python Script**
Let's start our scripting journey by writing the "Hello, World!" program in Python.
- In Interactive mode:
	- Open a command prompt or terminal and type `python`.
	- Type the following code and then press Enter:

			print("Hello World!")
	- The output "Hello, World!" will be displayed directly in the command prompt or terminal.

- In Script mode:
	- Create a new file in the text editor named `hello.py`.
	- Type the following code and save the file:

			print("Hello World!")
	- Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `hello.py` file.
	- Run your script by typing the following command:

			python hello.py
