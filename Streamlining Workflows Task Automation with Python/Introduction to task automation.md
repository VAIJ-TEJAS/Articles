# Task automation
Task automation plays a pivotal role in enhancing productivity across various industries and professions. By automating repetitive tasks, organizations can significantly reduce manual effort and minimize errors.
## Why Python for Task Automation?
Python is renowned as a versatile language for automating repetitive tasks across various domains. Its **simplicity**, **readability**, and **extensive library** support make it an ideal choice for tasks like **file management**, **data processing**, **web scraping**, and **system administration**.

# Getting Started with Python for Task Automation
## Setting Up the Python Environment
Here are the steps in short:

1.  **Install Python**: Download and install the latest version of Python from the official website ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)). Make sure to add Python to the system PATH during installation.  
2.  **Choose an IDE**: Select an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python development. Popular choices include PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and IDLE. Download and install the preferred IDE.   
3.  **(Optional) Set up Virtual Environment**: Use Python's built-in `venv` module or a third-party tool like `virtualenv` to create isolated Python environments for your projects. This helps manage dependencies and avoids conflicts between different projects.  
4.  **Install Required Packages**: Use `pip`, the Python package manager, to install any additional packages or libraries you need for your projects. For example, you can install packages like `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, or `pandas` using `pip install`.   
5.  **Test Your Setup**: Create a simple Python script and run it in your chosen IDE to ensure everything is set up correctly. You can print a "Hello, World!" message to verify that Python is installed and the IDE is configured properly.
## Writing Your First Automation Script
Let's create a simple Python script to automate a basic task, such as file management.

	#Simple Python Script for File Management
	import os
	
	def organize_files(directory):
	    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
	        if filename.endswith('.txt'):
	            # Move text files to a 'TextFiles' directory
	            os.rename(os.path.join(directory, filename), os.path.join(directory, 'TextFiles', filename))
	directory_path = 'C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\temp'
	organize_files(directory_path)

# Essential Python Libraries for Automation

##  OS Module

The `os` module in Python provides a **platform-independent** way of interacting with the **operating system**, offering functions for various operating system-related tasks such as **file and directory operations**, **process management**.

**Example :**

    import os
    cwd = os.getcwd()
    print("Current directory:", cwd)
    
    new_dir = os.path.join(cwd, 'new_directory')
    if not os.path.exists(new_dir):
        os.makedirs(new_dir)
        print("New directory created:", new_dir)
    else:
        print("Directory already exists:", new_dir)
    
    files = os.listdir(cwd)
    print("Files in current directory:", files)
    
    old_file = os.path.join(cwd, 'old_file.txt')
    new_file = os.path.join(cwd, 'new_file.txt')
    os.rename(old_file, new_file)
    print("File renamed from 'old_file.txt' to 'new_file.txt'")

![os_module][12]
<div class="div-blue"> <span class="alert-header">Note:</span> <span class="alert-body">While renaming the files make sure to create the file whose name you want to change.</span> </div>

## Shutil Module

The `shutil` module offers a high-level interface for **file operations**, including file **copying**, **moving**, and **deletion**.

**Example :**

    import shutil
    source_file = 'C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\temp\\source.txt'
    destination_file = 'C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\temp\\destination.txt'
    
    try:
        shutil.copy(source_file, destination_file)
        print("File copied successfully!")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Source file not found.")
    except PermissionError:
        print("Permission denied.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred:", e)

![shutil_module][13]
<div class="div-blue"> <span class="alert-header">Note:</span> <span class="alert-body">Make sure to pass the correct path of the source and destination file in the same way as mentioned above.</span> </div>

## Subprocess Module

The `subprocess` module in Python provides a powerful way to **spawn** new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. It allows you to execute system commands, run external programs, and interact with them programmatically from within your Python script.

**Example :**

    import subprocess
    try:
        #Run the command and capture output
        result = subprocess.run(['-l'], capture_output=True, text=True)
        # Print the command output
        print("Command output:", result.stdout)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Command not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred:", e)

![subprocess_module][14]

## Scheduled Module
The `schedule` module in Python provides a simple and intuitive way to schedule recurring tasks and automate job execution. It allows you to define tasks to be executed at specific intervals, such as daily, hourly, or at a custom frequency. With `schedule`, you can automate repetitive tasks like data backups, report generation, and system maintenance effortlessly.
**Example :**

	import schedule
	import time

	def print_message():
	    print("This message is printed every second.")
	schedule.every(1).seconds.do(print_message)
	while True:
	    schedule.run_pending()
	    time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second
![task_schedule]()
# Automating File and Data Management
## File Organization and Cleanup
Automating file organization, renaming, and cleanup tasks can significantly improve efficiency and maintain a tidy file system. Python provides powerful tools for automating these processes.

	import os
	import shutil

	def organize_files(directory):
	    # Create directories if they don't exist
	    if not os.path.exists(os.path.join(directory, 'Images')):
	        os.makedirs(os.path.join(directory, 'Images'))
	    if not os.path.exists(os.path.join(directory, 'Documents')):
	        os.makedirs(os.path.join(directory, 'Documents'))

    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        if filename.endswith(('.jpg', '.png', '.gif')):
            # Move image files to 'Images' directory
            shutil.move(os.path.join(directory, filename), os.path.join(directory, 'Images', filename))
        elif filename.endswith(('.pdf', '.docx', '.txt')):
            shutil.move(os.path.join(directory, filename), os.path.join(directory, 'Documents', filename))
    directory_path =  'C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\temp'
    organize_files(directory_path)

## Data Processing and Analysis
Automate data processing tasks using libraries like Pandas for parsing, cleaning, and transforming datasets.

	  import pandas as pd
	     data = {
	        'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
	        'Age': [25, 30, 35, 40],
	        'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston']
	      }
	    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
	    print("DataFrame:")
	    print(df)

-   **Lead Generation**: Extracting contact information for sales.
-   **Content Aggregation**: Collecting and curating content from multiple sources.
-   **Search Engine Indexing**: Indexing web pages for search engines.

## Using BeautifulSoup and Requests
Beautiful Soup and Requests form a powerful combination for web scraping tasks. Requests is used to fetch the HTML content of web pages, while Beautiful Soup is employed to parse and extract data from the HTML, enabling users to automate web interactions and extract valuable information from websites seamlessly.

	import requests
	from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
	#URL of the website to scrape
	url = 'https://www.google.com'
	response = requests.get(url)

	#Check if the request was successful (status code 200)
	if response.status_code == 200:
	    # Parse the HTML content of the page
	    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
	    links = soup.find_all('a')
	    for link in links:
	        print(link.text)
	        print("Retrival of data successfull")
	else:
	    print("Failed to retrieve data from the website.")

	def monitor_server():
	    cpu_usage = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)
	    memory_usage = psutil.virtual_memory().percent
	    disk_usage = psutil.disk_usage('/').percent
	    network_io = psutil.net_io_counters()
        timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
	    #Print server metrics
	    print("Timestamp:", timestamp)
	    print("CPU Usage:", cpu_usage, "%")
	    print("Memory Usage:", memory_usage, "%")
	    print("Disk Usage:", disk_usage, "%")
	    print("Network I/O (Bytes Sent/Received):", network_io.bytes_sent, "/", network_io.bytes_recv)
monitor_server()
![sys_admin]()

## Backup and Recovery Automation
Automating data backup, disaster recovery, and system restore tasks is essential for ensuring data integrity and continuity in the event of hardware failures, data loss, or system crashes.

	import shutil
	import os
	import datetime

	def backup_data(source_dir, dest_dir):
	    #Generate timestamp for backup folder
	    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
	    
	    #Create a backup folder with timestamp
	    backup_folder = os.path.join(dest_dir, f"backup_{timestamp}")
	    os.makedirs(backup_folder)
	    
	    #Copy files from source directory to backup folder
	    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(source_dir):
	        for file in files:
	            source_path = os.path.join(root, file)
	            dest_path = os.path.join(backup_folder, os.path.relpath(source_path, source_dir))
	            shutil.copy2(source_path, dest_path)
	    
	    print("Backup completed successfully.")

	source_directory = 'C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\src'
	destination_directory = 'C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop'
	backup_data(source_directory, destination_directory)
