    git add file.py            # Add a specific file
    git add .                  # Add all changes in the current directory

Caution: Avoid adding sensitive information such as passwords or API keys to a Git repository. Instead, make use of independent configuration files or environment variables.

## 3. git commit

The staged modifications are saved to the repository by using the `git commit` command:

    git commit -m "Commit message"

## 4. git status

The `git status` command shows the status of files in the repository:

    git status

## 5. git log

The `git log` command displays the commit history:

    git log

## 6. git diff

The `git diff` command shows the differences between files:

    git diff file.py

**Aside: The Staging Area**
The staging area is where changes are prepared before committing them to the repository. It allows for selective commits.

# Working with Branches

## **1. git branch**

The `git branch` command lists, creates, or deletes branches:

    git branch                    # List branches
    git branch new-feature        # Create a new branch
    git branch -d branch-name     # Delete a branch

<div class="div-green"> <span class="alert-header">Tip:</span> Use Meaningful Branch Names: When creating branches in Git, use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the branch, such as feature/xyz or bugfix/123. </div>

## **2. git checkout**

The `git checkout` command switches between branches:

    git checkout branch-name

**Traveling Back in Time: Examining a Specific Version of Your Code**

To revert your code to a previous commit, use the git checkout command followed by the commit hash:

    git checkout <commit-hash>

## **3. Merging Branches**

Merge branches using `git merge`:

    git merge branch-name
