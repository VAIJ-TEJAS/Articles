#### Basic Git Commands

1. `git init`

The `git init` command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

2. `git add`

The command `git add` is used to stage changes for the subsequent commit. You can add specific files or directories:

```bash
git add file.py            # Add a specific file
git add .                  # Add all changes in the current directory
```
Caution: Avoid adding sensitive information such as passwords or API keys to a Git repository. Instead, make use of independent configuration files or environment variables.

3. `git commit`

The staged modifications are saved to the repository by using the `git commit` command:

```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```
4. `git status`

The `git status` command shows the status of files in the repository:

```bash
git status
```

5. `git log`

The `git log` command displays the commit history:

```bash
git log
```

6. `git diff`

The `git diff` command shows the differences between files:

```bash
git diff file.py
```

**Putting It All Together: Simple Git Workflow**

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Make changes and stage them.
3.  Commit changes with a descriptive message.
4.  Push changes to the remote repository.
5.  Repeat steps 2-4 as necessary.
6.  Pull changes from the remote repository to stay up-to-date.

**Aside: The Staging Area**
The staging area is where changes are prepared before committing them to the repository. It allows for selective commits.

#### Working with Branches

1. `git branch`

The `git branch` command lists, creates, or deletes branches:

```bash
git branch                    # List branches
git branch new-feature        # Create a new branch
git branch -d branch-name     # Delete a branch
```
<div class="div-green"> <span class="alert-header">Tip:</span> Use Meaningful Branch Names: When creating branches in Git, use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the branch, such as feature/xyz or bugfix/123. </div>

2. `git checkout`

The `git checkout` command switches between branches:

```bash
git checkout branch-name
```
**Traveling Back in Time: Examining a Specific Version of Your Code**

To revert your code to a previous commit, use the git checkout command followed by the commit hash:

```bash
git checkout <commit-hash>
```
3. Merging Branches

Merge branches using `git merge`:

```bash
git merge branch-name
```

4. Resolving Merge Conflicts

When merging branches, resolve conflicts by editing the conflicting files and then committing the changes.

It's an essential aspect of open-source collaboration and legal protection.</div>

2. Setting up SSH Keys

Generate SSH keys and add them to your GitHub account for secure authentication:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your@email.com"
```

3. Pushing Local Repositories to GitHub

To push your local repository to GitHub, use the following commands:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
git push -u origin master
```
<div class="div-red"> <span class="alert-header">Caution:</span> Be Careful with Force Push: Avoid using **git push --force** (or **-f**) unless absolutely necessary. Force pushing can overwrite history and cause irreversible changes, potentially leading to data loss for you and collaborators.</div>

4. Cloning Repositories from GitHub

Use the following to copy a repository from GitHub to your PC:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
```

5. Forking Repositories and Creating Pull Requests

Fork repositories on GitHub to contribute changes. Create a pull request to propose your changes for merging into the original repository.

<div class="div-green"> <span class="alert-header">Tip:</span> Regularly Update Your Forks: If you fork a repository on GitHub to contribute changes, remember to regularly update your fork with changes from the original repository to avoid conflicts and stay in sync.</div>

6. Reviewing Pull Requests and Merging Changes

Review pull requests submitted by collaborators and merge changes into the main branch after review.

7. Fetching

The git fetch command downloads objects and refs from another repository, but it does not merge them into your current branch.

**Aside: What is a SHA**

A SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is a unique identifier for a commit. It's a 40-character string that uniquely identifies a commit.

### Advanced Git Concepts

1. Rebasing Commits

Rebase commits to maintain a linear commit history:

```bash
git rebase branch-name
```
<div class="div-blue"> <span class="alert-header">Note:</span> Understanding Git Rebase: While rebasing commits can create a cleaner commit history, it's important to understand that it rewrites commit history, which can cause conflicts for collaborators. Use with caution and communicate changes to team members.</div>

2. Git Aliases

Define aliases for commonly used Git commands:

```bash
git config --global alias.co checkout
```
