# Examples of Python Scripts for System Administration
**User Management**
We can create, modify, and delete user accounts using Python by calling system commands (`useradd`, `passwd`, `userdel`) via the `subprocess` module.
- **Creating User Account:** The process of adding a new user to the system with specified attributes such as username, password, and home directory.

	  import subprocess
	  
	  def create_user(username, password):
	      try:
	        subprocess.run(['powershell', '-Command', f'New-LocalUser -Name {username} -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString "{password}" -AsPlainText -Force)'])		#main_com
	        print(f"User '{username}' created successfully.")
	      except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
	        print(f"Error creating user '{username}': {e}")

	  create_user("Sia", "si@123")

	The equivalent Linux command can be obtained by replacing the main_com line by:
	
		subprocess.run(['useradd', '-m', username])

	The script uses the `subprocess` module to execute a PowerShell command, creating a new local user account. The `create_user` function constructs a PowerShell command with the provided username and password, utilizing the `New-LocalUser` or `useradd` cmdlet. Upon successful creation, a confirmation message is displayed; otherwise, an error message is shown.
	
	Output:
	
	![create_user][1]

- **Modifying User Account:** Making changes to an existing user account, such as updating user information or modifying permissions.

	  import subprocess

	  def modify_user(username, new_password):
	    try:
	        subprocess.run(['powershell', '-Command', f'Set-LocalUser -Name {username} -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString "{new_password}" -AsPlainText -Force)'])		#main_com
	        print(f"Password for user '{username}' modified successfully.")
	    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
	        print(f"Error modifying password for user '{username}': {e}")

	  modify_user("Sia", "si@456")

	The equivalent Linux command can be obtained by replacing the main_com line by:

		subprocess.run(['passwd', username], input=new_password.encode())

	The script employs the `subprocess` module to execute a PowerShell command, altering the password of an existing local user account. The `modify_user` function accepts parameters for the username and the new password, constructing a PowerShell command using string formatting or `passwd` command. If the operation succeeds, a confirmation message is shown.
	
	Output:
	
	![modify_user][2]

- **Deleting User Account:** Removing an existing user account from the system, including all associated files and directories.

		import subprocess

		def delete_user(username):
		    try:
		        subprocess.run(['powershell', '-Command', f'Remove-LocalUser -Name {username} -Force'])		#main_com
		        print(f"User '{username}' deleted successfully.")
		    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
		        print(f"Error deleting user '{username}': {e}")

		delete_user("Sia")

	The equivalent Linux command can be obtained by replacing the main_com line by:

		subprocess.run(['userdel', '-r', username])

	The script uses the `subprocess` module to execute a PowerShell command, deleting an existing local user account. The `delete_user` function accepts a `username` parameter indicating the user account to be deleted. It constructs a PowerShell command using string formatting, utilizing the `Remove-LocalUser`  or `userdel` cmdlet. After deletion, a success message is displayed.
	
	Output:
	
	![delete_user][3]


<div class="div-red"> <span class="alert-header">Caution:</span> <span class="alert-body"> Ensure that the script is executed with appropriate privileges to perform these actions.</span> </div>

**Setting User Permissions and Managing Access Control**
To set user permissions and manage access control with a script, you can utilize the `subprocess` module in Python to execute system commands for manipulating file permissions and access control lists (ACLs).

	import subprocess

	def set_permissions(file_path, user, permission):
	    try:
	        subprocess.run(['icacls', file_path, '/grant', f'{user}:{permission}'])		#main_com
	        print(f"Permissions set successfully for user '{user}' on '{file_path}'")
	    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
	        print(f"Error setting permissions: {e}")

	file_path = "myfile.txt"
	user = "Sia"
	permission = "F"  # Full control
	set_permissions(file_path, user, permission)

The equivalent Linux command can be obtained by replacing the main_com line by:

	subprocess.run(['chmod', permission, file_path])

The script uses the `icacls` or `chmod`command to modify file permissions. The `/grant` option specifies user and permissions, while the `permission` parameter allows customization using flags like F, M, RX, R, W, D.

**File System Management**
To automate file and directory operations such as creation, deletion, and modification in Python, you can use the `os` module for basic file and directory operations, and the `shutil` module for more advanced operations like copying and moving files.

- **File Creation, Modification and Deletion**

		import os

		def create_file(file_path):
		    try:
		        with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
		            pass  # Creating an empty file
		        print(f"File '{file_path}' created successfully.")
		    except Exception as e:
		        print(f"Error creating file '{file_path}': {e}")

		def delete_file(file_path):
		    try:
		        os.remove(file_path)
		        print(f"File '{file_path}' deleted successfully.")
		    except Exception as e:
		        print(f"Error deleting file '{file_path}': {e}")

		def modify_file(file_path, content):
		    try:
		        with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
		            f.write(content)
		        print(f"File '{file_path}' modified successfully.")
		    except Exception as e:
		        print(f"Error modifying file '{file_path}': {e}")

		file_path = "sample.txt"
		create_file(file_path)
		modify_file(file_path, "I hope you are enjoying so far!")
		delete_file(file_path)
		
	`create_file` creates an empty file at the specified path, `modify_file` modifies the content of an existing file with the provided content and `delete_file` deletes the file at the specified path.
	
	Output:

	![sampletxt][4]


- **Directory Creation, Modification and Deletion**

		import os

		def create_directory(directory_path):
		    try:
		        os.makedirs(directory_path, exist_ok=True)
		        print(f"Directory '{directory_path}' created successfully.")
		    except Exception as e:
		        print(f"Error creating directory '{directory_path}': {e}")

		def delete_directory(directory_path):
		    try:
		        os.rmdir(directory_path)
		        print(f"Directory '{directory_path}' deleted successfully.")
		    except Exception as e:
		        print(f"Error deleting directory '{directory_path}': {e}")

		def rename_directory(directory_path, new_name):
		    try:
		        os.rename(directory_path, new_name)
		        print(f"Directory '{directory_path}' renamed to '{new_name}' successfully.")
		    except Exception as e:
		        print(f"Error renaming directory '{directory_path}': {e}")

		directory_path = "sampledir"
		new_name = "samp_dir"
		create_directory(directory_path)
		rename_directory(directory_path, new_name)
		delete_directory(new_name)

	`create_directory` creates a new directory at the specified path, `rename_directory` renames an existing directory to the specified new name and `delete_directory` deletes the directory at the specified path.
	
	Output:

	![sampledir][5]

	After renaming:
	
	![samp_dir][6]

**Software Installation and Configuration**
- **Automating Software Installation and Updates**
Automating software installation and updates using package managers like `pip` or system-specific tools can be achieved through Python scripts.

	For example, to install and update the `numpy` package:

		import subprocess

		def install_package(package_name):
		    try:
		        subprocess.run(['pip', 'install', package_name])		#use 'pip' or 'pip3' as per configuration
		        print(f"Package '{package_name}' installed successfully.")
		    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
		        print(f"Error installing package '{package_name}': {e}")

		def update_package(package_name):
		    try:
		        subprocess.run(['pip', 'install', '--upgrade', package_name])		#use 'pip' or 'pip3' as per configuration
		        print(f"Package '{package_name}' updated successfully.")
		    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
		        print(f"Error updating package '{package_name}': {e}")

		package_name = "numpy"
		install_package(package_name)
		update_package(package_name)

	The `install_package` function installs a Python package using the `pip install` command. The `update_package` function updates a Python package to the latest version using the `pip install --upgrade` command.

- **Configuring Software Settings and Parameters**
You can use the `sys` module in Python to configure software settings programmatically, particularly for command-line arguments handling.

		import sys
		import subprocess

		def configure_with_tool(tool_path, arguments):
		    try:
		        subprocess.run([tool_path] + arguments, check=True)
		        print("Configuration successful.")
		    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
		        print(f"Error configuring with tool '{tool_path}': {e}")

		if __name__ == "__main__":
		    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
		        print("Usage: python script.py <tool_path> <arguments>")
		        sys.exit(1)

		    tool_path = sys.argv[1]
		    arguments = sys.argv[2:]
		    configure_with_tool(tool_path, arguments)

When you run the script from the command line, you'll provide the tool path as the first argument as follows:

	python Articles/software_settings.py "Articles//SimpleCalculator.exe"

**System Monitoring and Reporting**
You can use Python to gather system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space using various libraries and system commands.

	import psutil

	def get_cpu_usage():
	    cpu_usage = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)
	    return cpu_usage

	def get_memory_usage():
	    memory = psutil.virtual_memory()
	    total_memory = memory.total
	    available_memory = memory.available
	    used_memory = memory.used
	    memory_usage_percent = memory.percent
	    return {
	        "total_memory": total_memory,
	        "available_memory": available_memory,
	        "used_memory": used_memory,
	        "memory_usage_percent": memory_usage_percent
	    }

	def get_disk_usage():
	    partitions = psutil.disk_partitions()
	    disk_usage = {}
	    for partition in partitions:
	        partition_usage = psutil.disk_usage(partition.mountpoint)
	        disk_usage[partition.mountpoint] = {
	            "total": partition_usage.total,
	            "used": partition_usage.used,
	            "free": partition_usage.free,
	            "percent": partition_usage.percent
	        }
	    return disk_usage

	cpu_usage = get_cpu_usage()
	memory_usage = get_memory_usage()
	disk_usage = get_disk_usage()
	print("CPU Usage:", cpu_usage, "%")
	print("Memory Usage:", memory_usage)
	print("Disk Usage:", disk_usage)

The `get_cpu_usage` function retrieves CPU usage as a percentage, while `get_memory_usage` gathers memory statistics, and `get_disk_usage` collects disk stats. These functions utilize `psutil` methods for data retrieval.
